    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>The birth-rate in Berlin, it appears, is considerably lower
    this year than last. We can quite understand this reluctance to
    being born a German just now.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The official German films of the Battle of the Somme prove
    beyond doubt that if it had not been for the Allies the Germans
    would have won this battle.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The German military authorities have declined to introduce
    bathless days. Ablution, it appears, is one of the personal
    habits that the Teuton does not pursue to a vicious excess.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Some congestion of traffic is being experienced by the
    Midland Railway owing to the publicity given by the
    FOOD-CONTROLLER to the Company's one-and-ninepenny luncheon
    basket. Many people are finding it more economical to purchase
    a return ticket to the Midlands and lunch in the train than to
    go, as formerly, to one of the regular tea-shops.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>An egg four-and-a-half inches long and eight inches round
    has been laid by a hen at Southover, Lewes. It is understood
    that a proposal by the FOOD-CONTROLLER that this standard
    should be adopted as the compulsory minimum for the duration of
    the War is meeting with some opposition from Mr. PROTHERO.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"We must all be prepared to make sacrifices," says the
    <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i>. We understand that, acting upon this
    advice, several high command officers have volunteered to
    sacrifice the CROWN PRINCE.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Dublin Corporation has decided to pay full salaries from
    the date of their leaving work to those employees who until
    recently have been held under arrest for participation in the
    Sinn Fein rebellion. The idea of making them a grant for Kit
    and Field allowances has not yet come under consideration.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>German travellers, says a news item, are forbidden to take
    flowers with them into Austria. It is intended that the funeral
    shall be a quiet one.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Mr. DANIELS describes the shells made by American factories
    for the U.S. Navy as "colossally inferior" to those submitted
    by a British firm. The explanation is of course that the former
    are primarily designed to enforce universal peace.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Leicestershire farmer who applied for alien enemies to
    assist in farm-work was supplied with three Hungarians&mdash;a
    jeweller, a hairdresser and a tailor. His complaint is, we
    understand, that while he wanted his land to be well-dressed he
    didn't want it overdone.</p>

        <h4>NATURE'S TACTLESS MIMICRY.</h4>CURIOUS ATTITUDE ASSUMED
        BY TREES IN A DISTRICT OCCUPIED BY THE GERMANS.

    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A widely-known nocturnal pleasure resort makes the
    announcement that it is still open for business, the action of
    the Court having only deprived it of the right to sell
    intoxicating liquors. We fear it will be a case of
    <i>Hamlet</i> without the familiar spirit.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"We are not war-weary but war-hardened," said Mr. WINSTON
    CHURCHILL in a recent address. Germany, we are happy to state,
    is war-weary and will soon be Maximilian-Hardened.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The question as to whether war serves any useful purpose has
    been settled once for all. "The War has provided many incidents
    for this revue," says a stage paper of a new production.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A pig-sty has been erected in his rose-garden by a doctor in
    East Essex. The general idea is not new, though it is more
    usual to plant a rose-garden round your pig-sty, as a
    corrective.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is pointed out by an evening paper that the official
    prohibition of "fishing, washing and bathing" in the St.
    James's Park pond is superfluous, as the pond was dried up two
    years ago. In view of the exceptional severity of the weather
    the authorities will shortly replace the offending notice by
    another merely prohibiting skating.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Lord ROBERT CECIL has expressed his willingness to consider
    proposals for the reform of the British Consular service. The
    suggestion, however, that not more than seventy-five per cent.
    of our Consular representatives should be natives of Germany
    and the countries of her Allies seems a little too drastic.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Without proficiency with the gloves a man cannot make a
    really ideal soldier," said Lieut.-Col. SINCLAIR THOMSON to the
    Inns of Court O.T.C. On the other hand we still have a number
    of distinguished soldiers who before the War attached paramount
    importance to their cuffs, collars and ties.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The use of luminous paint is being widely advocated with the
    view of mitigating the dangers arising from the darkened
    streets. It is pointed out that the use of luminous language
    has already proved of extreme value in critical situations.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"You must shorten sail," said the Chairman of the Henley
    Tribunal to an employer who was said to have an indoor staff of
    thirteen servants. As a beginning he proposes to take a reef in
    the butler.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It appears that a reduction in the sale of chocolate will
    adversely affect the cinema. "All my young lady patrons," says
    a manager, "require chocolate in the cinema." It is feared that
    they will have to go back to the old-fashioned plan of chewing
    the corner of the programme.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>At Hull, the other day, a tram-car dashed into a grocer's
    shop. No blame attaches, we understand, to the driver, who
    sounded his gong three times.</p>

        [The enemy, in his turn, is exhibiting a film of the
        fighting on the Somme. At the close a statement is thrown

    <h3>HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.</h3>

    <p class="center">(<i>The KING OF THE HELLENES and the KAISER:
    On the Telephone</i>).</p>

    <p><i>The King.</i> HALLOA! Are you there? Halloa, halloa! Are
    you there, I say?</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> All right, all right. Who's talking?</p>

    <p><i>The King.</i> KING CONSTANTINE. I want a word with the
    KAISER.</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> Ha, TINO, it's you, is it? Fire away.</p>

    <p><i>The King.</i> Is that you, WILLIE?</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> Yes; what do you want? I haven't too much
    time.</p>

    <p><i>The King.</i> I say, the most awful thing has happened.
    The Allies have sent me an Ultimatum.</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> A what?</p>

    <p><i>The King.</i> An Ultimatum.</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> I say, old man, you really must speak
    louder and more plainly. I can't hear a word you say.</p>

    <p><i>The King.</i> The Allies have sent me an ULTIMATUM!! Did
    you hear that time?</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> Yes, most of it.</p>

    <p><i>The King.</i> Well.</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> Well.</p>

    <p><i>The King.</i> What do you think about it?</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> Not very much. Lots of other people have
    had ultimatums and haven't been one pfennig the worse for
    them.</p>

    <p><i>The King.</i> Oh, but this is the very last thing in
    ultimatums. It's a regular ultimatissimum.</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> What do they want you to do?</p>

    <p><i>The King.</i> All sorts of disagreeable things. For
    instance, I am to move my troops to the Peloponnese, so as to
    get them out of harm's way.</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> Well, move them. What are troops for
    except to be moved about? You can always move them back again,
    you know. I keep on moving troops forward and backward all the
    time. It's a mere nothing when you once get accustomed to it.
    Just you try it and see. Anything more?</p>

    <p><i>The King.</i> Yes; I'm to release from prison the
    followers of the pestilential VENIZELOS.</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> That's unpleasant, of course, for a
    patent Greek War-Lord; but I should do it if I were you, and
    then you can let me know how it feels.</p>

    <p><i>The King.</i> Look here, William, I don't know what's the
    matter with you, but I wish you wouldn't try to be so funny.
    You seem to think the whole affair's a sort of German joke. So
    it is, by Zeus&mdash;that's to say it's no joke at all.</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> Manners, TINO, manners.</p>

    <p><i>The King.</i> I'm sick and tired of all this talk.</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> If you go on like that I shall not talk
    to you any more.</p>

    <p><i>The King.</i> Don't say that; I could not bear such a
    loss. But, seriously, are you going to help as you
    promised?</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> I cannot help you now. You must play for
    time.</p>

    <p><i>The King.</i> I've exhausted all the possibilities of
    playing for time. It wouldn't be the least good. They really
    mean it this time, and they've given me a strictly limited
    period for compliance.</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> Well, I suppose you know best, but I
    should have thought you could have spun out negotiations for a
    hit&mdash;given them a little promise here and a little promise
    there on the chance of something turning up.</p>

    <p><i>The King.</i> The long and the short of it is that you
    promised to help us, but it was only a little promise here or
    there, and you don't mean to keep it. I shall accept the
    ultimatum.</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> The what? The telephone's buzzing
    again.</p>

    <p><i>The King.</i> The ULTIMATUM!!</p>

    <p><i>The Kaiser.</i> Oh, the ultimatum. Yes, by all means
    accept it. And, by the way, I'm publishing a volume of my
    War-speeches, and will make a point of sending you an early
    copy. You might get it reviewed in the Athens papers.</p>

    <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,&mdash;Notwithstanding the reckless speed of
    the leave train and the surfeit of luxuries and lack of company
    on the leave boat, our gallant warriors continue to volunteer
    in thousands for that desperate enterprise known as "Proceeding
    on leave to the U.K." There is however a certain artfulness in
    the business, if only artfulness for artfulness' sake.</p>

    <p>In the old days the ingenuity of man was concentrated upon
    extending by any means short of the criminal the duration of
    the leave. When Robert first went on leave he was young and
    innocent. He had four days given him; he left his unit on the
    first of them and was back with it on the last of them. The
    second time he improved on this and left France very early on
    the morning of his first day and arrived in France again very
    late on the last night of it. Then his friend John regarded
    <i>his</i> leave as beginning and ending in England, which, if
    the leave boat happens to be in mid-Channel at midnight, is not
    a distinction without a difference. Robert's next leave was for
    seven days, and he spent nine of them in the U.K. His
    explanation was logically unassailable, but logic is wasted on
    military authorities; after that, leave got fixed at ten days
    net, ten days of the inelastic sort.</p>

    <p>Give a man an inch and he'll take an ell; give him an ell
    and he is no man if he doesn't improve even on that. Moreover,
    how is one to fill in the dismal vacuum subsequent on the
    return from one leave otherwise than by the discussion of
    subtle schemes for the betterment of the next leave? The
    duration of it having assumed a cast-iron rigidity, it only
    remained to improve the manner of travelling to and fro. John
    ferreted about and became aware of the existence of a civilian
    train to the port and of a Staff boat to the other port. He
    worked up a friendship with a Fonctionnaire de Chemin de Fer,
    and took the civilian train; he made a very natural, if very
    regrettable, mistake on the quay, and crossed in the Staff
    boat. He was able to repeat the friendship and the mistake on
    the return journey, and had therefore every reason to be proud
    of his efforts. Nevertheless he firmly decided to say nothing
    about it to anybody lest the idea should get overworked. But he
    told Robert in confidence, and Robert told a lot of other
    people, also in confidence, and the idea did get overworked and
    is now (<i>vide</i> General Routine Orders, <i>passim</i>)
    unworkable.</p>

    <p>There was still scope however for Robert's ingenuity next
    time. There are other ways of getting to ports than by train.
    Why hold aloof from Motor Transport Drivers of the A.S.C. or be
    above making a personal friend or two among them? And if Orders
    limit the use of cars to officers of very senior rank, why be
    too proud to take a Colonel about with you? If when you get to
    the quay the leave boat wants you, but you don't want it, and
    if you want the Staff boat and it doesn't want you, it's no use
    arguing about it. You sulk unostentatiously in the background
    until both boats are full, and then you state a piteous case of
    urgent family affairs to the right officer, to find yourself
    eventually crossing with the comfort-loving civilians in their
    special boat. Robert was entirely satisfied with the way he
    wangled it, but, meaning to wangle it again in a few months'
    time, he decided to tell no one about it, not even John. But he
    did tell John as soon as he saw him, and John told the world.
    Thus, a further series of G.R.O.'s got written, published, and
    very carefully brought to the attention of all ranks.</p>

    <p>The earth having become full of free booklets containing
    watertight rules and regulations for keeping officers to the
    straight and narrow path to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"
       id="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span> U.K., and the roads,
       railways, quays and gangways being policed with stalwarts
       whom it is impossible to circumvent and unwise to push into
       the sea, the only remaining resource is to apply to the
       Officer in Charge. I am told, at first hand, that there is
       as much variety in the reasons urged in support of
       applications as there is in the manner of the applicants.
       They attempt to melt him with piteous tales of their future
       in England, to shame him with gruesome pictures of their
       recent past in France, to hustle him with emergencies or
       special duties, or to bully him with dark references to
       unseen powers. I had a list of them from an M.L.O. himself,
       who was highly suspicious even of me, until he understood
       that I only wanted one thing in the world, and that was
       someone interesting to talk to while I waited for the leave
       boat to sail. Instance after instance he gave me of the low
       cunning of my species, to all of which, as I ventured to
       guess, he had proved himself equal. In the circumstances, as
       he said, this might suggest some hardness of heart on his
       part, but I readily agreed, was even the first to state,
       that there was no one in the wide world more anxious to
       assist our irrepressibles when bent on their hard-earned
       holiday. But he just couldn't do it. I put it for him that
       he was but the powerless and insignificant agent of an
       authority greater than himself.</p>

    <p>To that he said "Yes, and No," always, I think, a safe
    answer. True, he had his duty to perform, and right well he
    performed it, we agreed. But he had also his powers, his
    responsibilities&mdash;might we say, his scope? Yet, I
    gathered, there were things which, not being entirely master of
    himself and his affairs, he could not do. Take my own case, for
    example. I suggested (very cautiously) that it would require a
    very much greater authority than himself to give relief to an
    ordinary person like myself, with no stronger reason to travel
    by the civilian boat than that my whole financial future and
    domestic happiness depended upon my doing so. He said nothing
    to that; I gave him but a very little chance. I said that I
    knew quite well that he would help me if he could. We were
    unanimous as to the kindness of his heart. It was because I
    quite realized that he couldn't that I didn't ask him or think
    of asking him. Very soon after that we parted, I to sail for
    England&mdash;but not by the leave boat.</p>

    <p>Alas! for the weakness of human nature. I am no stronger nor
    more able to be secretive than Robert, John and the rest of the
    brethren. I bragged; and now I'm told there is a printed order
    posted outside that M.L.O.'s office, making it a crime
    punishable with death for any officer proceeding on leave to
    converse or attempt to enter into conversation with the
    M.L.O.</p>

    <p>The only other thing I have to mention to you, Charles, upon
    this subject, is the application of a very earnest young
    lieutenant, who, I'm sure, would always obey all rules and
    regulations, both in letter and spirit, with scrupulous regard.
    His application is worth setting out in full:&mdash;"I have the
    honour to apply for leave to the United Kingdom to get married
    from January 9th to January 18th inclusive."</p>

    <h4>SEASONABLE NOVELTIES.</h4>

    <p>The enterprise of the London and North-Western Railway
    officials, in designing a button to obviate delays at the gate
    caused by the new show-your-season order, has (we understand)
    spurred other lines to a similar ingenuity. Below are some of
    the latest novelties in ticket-substitutes.</p>

    <p>THE POM-POM.&mdash;May be worn in any variety of hat. Very
    suitable for short travellers. A simple inclination of the head
    permits verification by the inspector. Made in two
    shades&mdash;dark green, covering any distance up to
    twenty-five miles of town, or red (as worn by anarchists and
    the staff of the L. &amp; S.W.R.), covering a journey up to
    fifty miles.</p>

    <p>UMBRELLA AND STICK TOPS, unscrewable, faced with
    plate-glass, permitting the insertion of a ticket, and its easy
    verification on being thrust under the nose of an official.
    Special quality <span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"
       id="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span> fitted with small electric
       bulb for evening wear.</p>

    <p>For those who desire a really striking and chic novelty,
    that up-to-date line, the Great Eccentric, is reported to have
    engaged a staff of expert tattoo artists, who will puncture the
    date and designation of the pass upon the left cheek of the
    holder. Being not only elegant in design but practically
    irremovable, these markings will form a permanent and
    increasingly interesting memento of the Great War. Price
    according to distance and lettering.</p>

    <h3>EDWARD.</h3>

    <p>Edward has red hair, a robust appearance, and a
    free-and-easy way with him. His free-and-easy way shows itself
    chiefly in his habit of smiling upon and waving his hand to all
    those whom he encounters on his daily walks. He is talkative at
    times, but his vocabulary is limited. In my opinion it is
    limited to one word, though his mother can distinguish several
    words, or says so. She must have a very much keener ear than I
    have&mdash;or a less rigid regard for the truth.</p>

    <p>You will have guessed that Edward is under military age. To
    be exact, it is thirteen months since he first saw the light in
    this troubled world. Not that the world is a troubled one to
    Edward; on the contrary.</p>

    <p>Edward takes his daily walks in his perambulator upon the
    sea-front of his native town. His free-and-easy way has secured
    him a large circle of acquaintance there. Elderly gentlemen
    stop and speak to him, which he likes, so long as they do not
    pat his cheek, a habit far too prevalent among elderly
    gentlemen. Mothers of other babies are loud in his praises,
    though in their hearts they are probably comparing him
    unfavourably with their own offspring. Altogether Edward has a
    cheery life.</p>

    <p>Upon a certain day Edward fell in with a very little
    man&mdash;so little, indeed, that most people would have called
    him a dwarf. He was walking in the same direction as Edward,
    and overtaking him, and Edward waved his hand and smiled and
    waved again.</p>

    <p>For a while the little man ignored these overtures. But at
    length he felt obliged to return them, and remarked to Kate,
    who propels the perambulator, "Seems friendly like;" to which
    Kate replied, "Oh, he always waves to everyone."</p>

    <p>Now the majority of people would have been rather repelled
    by that remark. For myself I may say that, though Edward always
    smiles when we meet, I do not greatly value it because I know
    he smiles in the same way upon everyone else.</p>

    <p>But it was not so with the little man. To be classed with
    "everyone," to be placed by Edward on an equality with the
    strong and graceful, sent a warm glow to his heart.</p>

    <p>So Edward, in his free-and-easy fashion, had, like the
    boy-scouts, done one good deed that day.</p>

    <p>So much good has notoriously been done during the great
    conflict by letters to the Press that Mr. Punch, recognising
    the importance of having this branch of War-work taught to the
    young, has engaged a gentleman of ample leisure and few
    responsibilities, who hides behind the <i>nom de guerre</i>
    "Paterfamilias," to deliver a series of instructive lectures on
    the subject. By the time the student has absorbed a complete
    course he will he qualified to write to the papers on any
    topic, and, to adopt every tone from the pleading and querulous
    to the indignant and hectoring. From this can follow nothing

    <p>SIR,&mdash;Could anything be more deplorable than the
    spectacle, which every hour of the day and night affords, of
    young and vigorous men made up to look like grandfathers. I am
    told that the theatrical costumiers and perruquiers are worn to
    a shadow by the overwork which these contemptible shirkers have
    subjected them to, and I call on you to use your powerful
    influence to stop it. I am credibly informed that if a
    courageous investigator visiting those funkholes, the clubs of
    London, were to snatch at the bald scalps so much in evidence
    there, he would in nine cases out of ten find that they came
    away in his hand, revealing the chevelure of the youthful and
    fit but craven. At any rate the experiment should be tried. I
    shall, of course, be told that the Tribunals are active and
    vigilant and their net so tightly drawn that no one can get
    through; but we all know what bunglers the English authorities
    are, whether at the War Office or elsewhere. It is only in
    newspaper offices that true efficiency can be found. I enclose

    <h3>THE HARDSHIPS OF BILLETS.</h3>

    <p>As Jim and me lies in hospital gettin' better from our
    wounds we talks over what we've been through in this War.</p>

    <p>There was the time when we was billeted with Mrs. Dawkins,
    just before we went to the Front, which dwells in our memories.
    When the billetin' orficer introduced us into her kitchen Mrs.
    Dawkins went down on the bricks and prayed she might do her
    duty by the two noble defenders of her country&mdash;she meant
    me and Jim&mdash;who the Lord had pleased to deliver into her
    care. Then she begun unlacin' Jim's boots. In a minute Mr.
    Dawkins come in; he said we was hearty welcome, and was just
    goin' to shake 'ands with us when Mrs. Dawkins turned on 'im
    and asked 'im what he meant by standin' there like a gawk and
    not unlacin' mine. Jim and me was very uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>Then some little Dawkinses come in, Susan, Sammy, Billy and
    Elfreda, and was told by Mrs. Dawkins to pay their respecks to
    us, and do it proper or she'd know the reason why. Sammy
    saluted left-'anded and she cuffed him unmerciful. Jim and me
    begun to feel regler low-spirited.</p>

    <p>After that she set out the tea. It was as butiful a tea as
    we could wish for, cakes and jam, and bloater-paste and
    sardines, and bein' hungry after a long march we cheered up and
    looked forward to enjoyin' it. As was correck Jim 'anded all
    the dishes to Mrs. Dawkins first, but she said, "No, thank you,
    such things are for the defenders of the country, and it is our
    duty to provide them, but bread-and-dripping is good enough for
    me and Mr. Dawkins and the children."</p>

    <p>Susan, Sammy, Billy and Elfreda all begun to cry, and their
    father sat lookin' at 'em, the picture of misery. It clean took
    away our appetites. She piled our plates with jam and sardines,
    but we couldn't swaller a mouthful with them poor kids sobbin'
    all round the table. We was thankful they was put to bed before
    supper. Mrs. Dawkins fried potaters and sausages and set 'em
    down in front of me Jim, with a jug of porter, and she and
    Dawkins and a young man lodger sat at the other end, behind
    half a Dutch cheese and some water. All the meals was the
    same.</p>

    <p>There was only three rooms upstairs, and Jim and me couldn't
    make out how it was we had a bedroom apiece till we come across
    the lodger sleepin' on the kitchen table, Dawkins on the mangle
    and Sammy in one of the dresser drawers. Then we asked to be
    allowed to sleep together, with the lodger to one side; but
    Mrs. Dawkins said, "I thank the Lord we're blessed with two
    good beds in our house, and as long as I have two defenders of
    the country in my care I should like to catch anyone belonging
    to me getting into either of their beds. If we're all getting
    wore out for want of sleep we can't help ourselves, we're doing
    our duty."</p>

    <p>Then she asked Jim if he was warm enough nights, and before
    he'd time to think he'd blurted out he wasn't quite. That
    evening she come down shiverin' to supper in her petticut, and
    said what did it matter her catchin' her death of cold if them
    she had in her care slept warm and comfortable under her
    meriner skirt. We felt downright brutes.</p>

    <p>But what hurt us most was the way them kids took against us.
    Me and Jim is fond of kids, and we wanted to make friends and
    play with 'em, but it weren't no good. They was always puttin'
    their tongues out at us when Mrs. Dawkins' back was turned and
    talkin' loud to one another: "I say, Sammy, I 'ates soldiers,
    don't you? Soldiers is greedy; poor little children don't have
    nothink where soldiers is. Daddy 'ates soldiers too. He says
    his 'ome is a 'ell since the soldiers come. 'Ere they are
    walkin' down the street. Quick, Billy! Mother ain't lookin';
    turn yer nose up at 'em same as me."</p>

    <p>To make up for her kindness to us Jim and me tried to do
    little odd jobs about the house for Mrs. Dawkins, but somehow
    it all turned to wormwood. We slipped out early one Sunday
    morning and begun siftin' the cinders in the backyard, but she
    caught sight of us and 'ollered so at Dawkins she woke up all
    the neighbours: "How can you lay there snorin', you great lazy
    good-for-nothing, and look on while the defenders of your
    country is wearin' themselves out 'siftin' your cinders?"</p>

    <p>Dawkins tumbled off the mangle, thinkin' it was a fire, and
    he swore terrible at me and Jim.</p>

    <p>The young man lodger took against us too. When his washin'
    was on the line we couldn't help noticin' he was very bad off
    for underclothes, and Jim and me, havin' more shirts and socks
    that kind ladies had give us than we knowed how' to wear, we
    took the liberty of wrappin' three of each in paper with a
    label, "Hopin' no offence," and puttin' it in the chicken-'ouse
    where he was in the habit of doin' his hair. We was pleased to
    notice next day he had got one of the shirts on. Of course we
    made no remark; no more did he. But at supper-time Mrs. Dawkins
    caught sight of his cuffs. She took the poor feller by the
    collar and we was afraid she would have shook the life out of
    him.</p>

    <p>"You thievin' rascal!" she said. "To think I should 'arbour
    in my house a man as ain't ashamed to rob the defenders of his
    country of the shirts off their backs!" Then she begun callin'
    for the police.</p>

    <p>Jim and me tried to explain, but it weren't no use. The
    first chance he had the young man lodger got out through the
    door. He come back in half a minute with his feet bare and his
    weskit all anyhow. The shirts and socks was under his arm.</p>

    <p>"Damn you and yer clothes!" he said, and flung 'em at me and
    Jim. It were very disheartenin'.</p>

    <p>When it come to leavin' we felt we ought to show our
    gratitude for the treatment we had received by makin' Mrs.
    Dawkins a little present. Bein' of an uncommon disposition it
    were difficult to choose what would please her. I were in
    favour of a pink shawl; but Jim didn't seem to fancy givin'
    anybody any more clothes. In the end we chose a pair of
    earrings.</p>

    <p>Directly we give 'em to her we saw we'd done wrong. She
    turned on Dawkins like a hyener. "'Ave I done my duty and
    starved us all to death and given them two the best in the
    house and slept cold every night to be paid in gewgaws?" she
    said. "Didn't I do it willin', and wouldn't I do it agen? and
    are you a man or a cur that you stand there expectin' me to put
    them things into my ears instead of behind the fire?" In
    another minute the earrings was melted. It were some
    consolation to me and Jim that she didn't refuse to shake 'ands
    with us when we come away; but Dawkins did, and so did the
    young man lodger, and all the little Dawkinses spit at us. We
    never have been able to make out who were to blame. We thinks
    sometimes it were Mrs. Dawkins.</p>

    <h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

    <p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned
    Clerks.</i>)</p>

    <p>Do you remember a clever, gloomy story that Mr. HUGH WALPOLE
    wrote, some years ago, about a pack of schoolmasters who got so
    monstrously upon one another's nerves that the result was
    attempted murder? I have just been reading a new story that may
    be regarded as the female counterpart of the same tragedy.
    <i>Regiment of Women</i> (HEINEMANN) is described as a first
    novel; and there are indeed signs of this in a certain
    verbosity and diffuseness of attack. But it is at least equally
    clear that the writer, CLEMENCE DANE, has the root of the
    matter in her. As in the book with which I have compared it,
    the setting of this is scholastic&mdash;a girls' school here,
    with all its restricted outlook, its small intrigues, and
    exaggerated friendships, mercilessly exposed. You will be
    willing to admit that it is at least aptly named when I tell
    you that not till page 135 does so much as the shadow of a man
    appear, and then but fleetingly as the father of the poor
    child, <i>Louise</i>, the tragedy of whose death is the central
    incident of the book. Naturally it can be nothing else than a
    painful story; in particular the figure of <i>Clare</i>, the
    adored teacher, whose cruel egoistical friendship, with its
    alternations of encouragement and brutality, first drives
    <i>Louise</i> to suicide, and all but wrecks the life of the
    young assistant-mistress, <i>Alwynne</i>, has in it something
    coldly sinister that haunts the memory. But of its power there
    can be no question. On one small point of psychology I am at
    issue with the writer. I doubt whether the child <i>Louise</i>
    could have played <i>Arthur</i> in the school theatricals so
    marvellously as we are asked to believe without cheering
    herself, by such an artistic success, out of the temptation to
    suicide. But the ways of morbidity are unsearchable, and this
    is no more than an expression of individual opinion. It is not
    meant to qualify my admiration for the skill of this remarkable
    and arresting story.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>If the long postponement of the appearance of another
    novel&mdash;<i>Vesprie Towers</i> (SMITH, ELDER)&mdash;by the
    late Mr. THEODORE WATTS-DUNTON, means (I am careful not to say
    it does) that the author never intended it to see the light of
    day, honesty obliges one to admit that there may have been
    wisdom in that decision, for the story of <i>Violet
    Vesprie</i>, though touched with a certain charm and
    distinction, sadly lacks the imaginative intensity of
    <i>Aylwin</i>. The plot is commonplace, being the familiar
    record of how the country seat of a once illustrious family
    nearly, but of course not quite, passed into the hands of
    strangers when the last of the race came to poverty. Even the
    inevitable flight to London is not spared us or the heroine,
    and it is really only when the writer tires of his attempted
    conventionality that he comes more nearly to his own. The
    return of <i>Violet</i> to her old home, for instance, is most
    fortunate in its failure to follow the rules, that attractive
    young lady being quite content to be whisked back in the
    turning of a page from destitution in Lambeth to the place she
    loves, without knowing or caring at all how the miracle has
    been wrought; while we, reader and author alike, equally in the
    dark, are too happy to have her home to worry about it either,
    preferring to wander with her through the dear old rooms and
    let explanations go hang. Anyhow, perhaps
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"
       id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span> one can forgive a certain
       amount of looseness in a story that holds such pleasant
       things as a family rainbow, an "osier ait" and a sailor-poet
       worshipping from afar. And indeed, though far from
       brilliant, the book is really rather lovable.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In <i>The Leatherwood God</i> (JENKINS) Mr. W.D. HOWELLS has
    written a powerful and very interesting study of an unusual
    theme. Religious mania, and those queer manifestations of it
    that hover uncertainly between fraud and hysteria, have always
    provided a subject of attraction for the curious. Mr. HOWELLS
    sets his romance in the early days of the last century, at the
    backwoods settlement of <i>Leatherwood</i>, where the community
    of the faithful are perturbed by the arrival amongst them of a
    stranger, one <i>Dylks</i>, who claims divine origin and the
    power to work miracles. Actually, this <i>Dylks</i> was about
    as bad a hat as any made. He had deserted his legal wife,
    <i>Nancy</i>, and allowed her, in supposed widowhood, to marry
    a <i>de facto</i> husband whom she adored. So you will see that
    the turning up again of Number One, unrecognised and surrounded
    by the trappings of god-head and the adoration of the Elect,
    creates for <i>Nancy</i> a very pretty and absorbing problem in
    social ethics. But Mr. HOWELLS has done more than this. Having
    shown <i>Dylks</i> as the arch-villain and impostor that he is,
    he proceeds to the subtler task of enlisting our sympathy for
    him. It is this that gives the story its higher quality. The
    horror of the poor wretch's position, driven on by his own
    words, almost, in time, coming himself to a kind of belief in
    them, haunted always by the increasing demands of his dupes, is
    most powerfully portrayed. So much so that in the end we hear
    of his death (by suicide or accident) with an emotion of relief
    and pity that is a real tribute to his creator. <i>The
    Leatherwood God</i> is not a long story, but for concentrated
    power it deserves to be classed amongst the outstanding work of
    the season.</p>

    course in a strictly literary sense. It must at this moment
    have required some courage to make your hero an agent of the
    British Secret Service. And having done this she certainly
    shirks none of the unpleasant possibilities of the situation so
    created. In the interest of his profession, and for no reward
    save the service of his country, <i>Marcus Janover</i> is
    called upon to sacrifice love, friendship, even his personal
    honour. Just how all this comes about I leave you to discover
    by <i>The Light above the Cross Roads</i> (DUCKWORTH). It is a
    powerful and highly original story that has the distinction of
    breaking entirely new ground in war-novels. The scenes of it,
    laid partly in Ireland, partly in Berlin, or behind the German
    lines, are themselves guarantees of the unusual. One slight
    criticism that I have to make rises from the question whether
    so expert an "agent" as <i>Marcus</i> would really employ
    blot-producing ink for his map tracery when, on his own
    confession, he might have used pencil. But if the blots had not
    been there the Prussians (oddly obtuse as to the real meaning
    of <i>Marcus's</i> presence amongst them) would never have
    arrested <i>Ursule</i>, and thus provided a dramatic and
    unhackneyed situation. There is a gravity and distinction,
    moreover, about the tale that somehow reminds me of the late
    Monsignor BENSON. It is undoubtedly a story that should be
    read.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I am rather puzzled what to say about the <i>The Grey
    Shepherd</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON), because it is essentially
    a story that will appeal very differently to readers of
    different temperaments. Some people will say, "How beautiful!"
    Others perhaps, "How precious!" and both with a certain truth.
    For my own part, I should select a middle course, and say that
    Mrs. J.E. BUCKROSE has had a wholly admirable idea for a short
    story, which she has done her best to spoil by enlarging it to
    book dimensions, and a little over-sweetening it. There is real
    delicacy and beauty in her theme. The youth forced by partial
    blindness to give up all the hopes for which he had been
    educated, who becomes a shepherd, solacing himself with his
    pipe (musical) and the simplicities of country lore for the
    loss of love and ambition; and eventually, after his death, is
    deified by rustic tradition into a supernatural helper of "all
    things that are kind"&mdash;here is an idea for the tenderest
    handling. My feeling is, while giving Mrs. BUCKROSE every
    credit for such an inspiration, that she should have been a
    little sterner with herself over the treatment, and thus
    avoided a certain stickiness that may irritate those who prefer
    the simplicity of nature to a not quite sufficiently concealed
    art. But, as I began by saying, it all depends on the
    individual palate; and, anyhow, the book has the historic
    excuse of being a very little one, which you can read, with
    pleasure or irritation, within the hour.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>If you should chance to hanker for a change from novels in
    which the hero and heroine dally over-long in falling in love
    you will get it by reading <i>The Fur-Bringers</i> (HODDER AND
    STOUGHTON). No time is wasted upon preliminaries, not a minute;
    and as soon as <i>Ambrose Deane</i> and <i>Colina Gaviller</i>
    have met and discovered at sight that they are just made for
    each other the really exciting part of the story begins. I
    forget how many times <i>Ambrose</i> is arrested during the
    course of the tale, but I do know that things keep on happening
    all the time, and that the rescue of the hero by the Indian
    girl <i>Nesis</i> is delightfully told. Altogether Mr. HULBERT
    FOOTNER'S picture of the life of a trader in Athabasca is
    particularly attractive. I like it all, including the
    cover.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
